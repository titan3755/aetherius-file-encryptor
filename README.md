# Aetherius File Encryptor

![repimage](https://i.ibb.co/31CZNzc/Aetherius.png)

Aetherius is a command-line based easy-to-use file encryptor which can be used to securely encrypt and decrypt readable non-binary files with the help of multiple algorithms with the click of a button.

With the help of this app, you can encrypt and decrypt your data in the most secure algorithms available which are AES-256 and RSA. Also, you will have a choice in the app regarding which algorithm to use in order to encrypt or decrypt your files. The encrypted files with a ".aeta" extension are the AES-256 encrypted files and the encrypted files with a ".aetr" extension are the RSA encrypted files. There is also a file with ".aetk" extension in the "aetherius" directory of your documents folder which contains the hashed version of your password. The profiles you create using the app will be stored in a specific folder named by your username in the "aetherius" folder of your documents folder as well as the files you encrypted while being logged into that specific account.

This app is still in early development stage and bugs are obviously expected. So, feel free to open issues in this repository and report those problems to me and also leave your suggestions to improve this app there. More features for this app will be coming in the future.
